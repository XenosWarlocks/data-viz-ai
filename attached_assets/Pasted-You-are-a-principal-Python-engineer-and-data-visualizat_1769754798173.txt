You are a principal Python engineer and data-visualization product designer. Your task is to design and implement a project-based, interactive Python data visualization application with a clear user workflow, dynamic graph suggestions, and real-time updates.

The output must resemble a usable data exploration tool, not a one-off visualization script.

🔹 Product-Level User Flow (MANDATORY)

The app must strictly follow this lifecycle:

Create Project

Add Column(s)

Add Data to Column(s)

Automatically Suggest Graphs

Render Selected Graph(s)

Iterate (add more columns/data → refresh suggestions & graphs)

Each step must build on the previous one.

🔹 1. Project System

A Project is the top-level container.

Each project contains:

Metadata (name, description)

One or more columns

Visualization state (selected graphs, settings)

Projects exist in memory only (no database).

🔹 2. Column Management
Column Definition

Columns are created explicitly by the user.

Each column has:

Name

Data type (default: categorical)

List of values (strings or numbers)

Column Actions

Users must be able to:

Add a column

Rename a column

Delete a column

Select an active column

🔹 3. Data Entry & Processing
Data Input

Users add data into a selected column.

Data can be:

Entered manually (one per line or comma-separated)

Edited after entry

Processing Rules

Normalize categorical values:

Case-insensitive

Trim whitespace

Maintain raw values + normalized values internally.

🔹 4. Distribution & Term Management

For categorical columns:

Compute frequency distributions.

Display terms in descending frequency order.

Term Merging

Users can:

Select multiple terms

Merge them into one canonical term

Merging must:

Instantly recompute distributions

Trigger graph updates

Be reversible (reset merges)

🔹 5. Intelligent Graph Suggestions (CORE FEATURE)

The system must suggest graphs automatically based on:

Number of columns

Column data types

Data distribution characteristics

Examples:

1 categorical column → bar chart, pie chart

Large category count → horizontal bar, top-N bar

2 categorical columns → grouped bar chart

Categorical + numeric → bar + aggregation

Multiple columns → comparison views

Graph Suggestion Rules:

Suggestions must update automatically when:

A column is added

Data is added/edited

Terms are merged

Each suggestion must include:

Graph type

Why it’s recommended

🔹 6. Graph Rendering & Customization
Default Behavior

After the first column + data:

Render a default suggested graph automatically

Users can switch between suggested graphs.

Customization Options

Users must be able to:

Choose graph type

Select column(s) to visualize

Sort ascending / descending

Limit to top-N categories

Adjust titles and labels

🔹 7. Multi-Column Iteration Flow

When users:

Add another column

Add data to it

The system must:

Re-evaluate all columns

Update graph suggestions

Preserve existing graphs unless the user changes them

Offer new comparison graphs when appropriate

🔹 8. Technical Constraints
Tech Stack

Language: Python

Visualization: Plotly (preferred for interactivity) or Matplotlib/Seaborn

UI Framework: Streamlit or Dash (choose one and justify)

Architecture Requirements

Modular design:

Project model

Column model

Distribution engine

Graph suggestion engine

Rendering layer

No monolithic scripts.

🔹 9. UX Expectations

Real-time updates (no app restart).

Clear visual indicators for:

Active project

Active column

Suggested vs selected graphs

Minimal user friction: sensible defaults everywhere.

🔹 10. Deliverables

Fully functional Python app.

Explanation of:

Project → column → data → graph flow

Graph suggestion logic

How updates propagate through the system

Clear instructions to:

Run the app

Add new graph types

Extend suggestion logic

🔹 Success Criteria

The app is successful if:

A user can start from zero and intuitively reach meaningful graphs.

Graphs adapt automatically as data evolves.

The structure feels scalable, not hacked together.
